## FAQ

### Why don't we build with TypeScript?

- It is for mock-up, means it won't be our main frontend.
- Therefore, we shouldn't waste time on caring about types.

### Why don't we set up a complete lint rules?

- See "Why don't we build with TypeScript?".
- Therefore, we shouldn't waste time on dealing with linting.

### Why Component-Driven Development (CDD)?

- Make the structure clear since we shouldn't waste time on finding our components ;)
